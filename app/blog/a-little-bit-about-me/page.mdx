## Hey, thanks for stopping by.

About a year ago I decided to build an advertising portfolio on a no-code website builder, and I've been hooked ever since. So much so that I made a bold decision to leave my creative advertising role in mid-2024 to pursue a future in tech.

Now, almost a year later, I couldn’t be happier with my decision. I recently graduated from Dev Academy’s intensive 800+ hour Full Stack bootcamp (May 2025). My day-to-day was filled with hands-on kata challenges, pair programming, weekly frontend and backend projects, code reviews, and so much more. It was essentially a simulated workplace, which introduced me to front-end development. I’ve found that my background in creative advertising has given me a solid foundation in user and design principles, which I now bring to web design and front-end development.

I’m excited about what’s ahead for me and feel driven to keep learning and growing as a developer and a designer.
